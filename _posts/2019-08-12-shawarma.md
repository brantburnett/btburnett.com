summary: Shawarma supports blue/green deployment of Kuberntes microservices where the service is processing background work such as queued messages
---
In the modern world of cloud-based microservices and continuous delivery, [blue/green deployments](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html) (a.k.a red/black deployments) have become commonplace. This approach provides a way to safely deploy an application with zero down time, and quickly roll back to the previous version if there is a problem. If you're deploying in the cloud and **not** using blue/gren deployments, stop
reading now and go find out what you're missing.

At [CenterEdge Software](https://centeredgesoftware.com/) our primary deployment
strategy is blue/green deployments to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using
[Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/). However, in practice we quickly discovered a
limitation of the typical blue/green deployment strategy.

## TL;DR

We've solved the problem of blue/green deployments of message bus consumers on
Kubernetes using a lightweight sidecar and a simple application plugin. We call the system
[Shawarma](https://github.com/CenterEdge/shawarma). (Yes, it's an Avengers MCU reference)

## The Problem

The key to blue/green deployments is the ability to route incoming requests to just
the active version of the service, leaving the inactive version idle. This works great
for incoming HTTP requests, as the blue/green deployment pipeline will put the active
service on the load balancer and remove the inactive service. You'll only have a brief
window where both versions are serving HTTP requests.

However, queued messages being processed from your message bus, such as [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), should be restricted as well.
These also represent a form of input, like HTTP requests, which should only be
processed by the active version. However, message bus processing is normally a pull
process, not push, which makes the problem more complicated.

## Possible Solutions

There are several possible approaches to solving the problem, but many suffer from
too much complexity. For example, one approach is to separate message bus processing
from the service and forward requests to the service over HTTP. I'll call this the Redirection Approach.

![Redirection Approach](/assets/images/shawarma-redirection.jpg)

This approach helps to maintain separation of concerns, since the service itself isn't
required to know about its deployment or understand if it's the active or inactive
version. However, it adds a lot of complexity, requires deploying an additional service,
and results in a signifcant performance hit for high-volume queues.

Another approach, which I'll call the Colorful Service Approach, requires that the
service know about its deployment status by monitoring the load balancer.

![Colorful Service Approach](/assets/images/shawarma-colorful.jpg)

The Colorful Service Approach is simpler in many ways, but now our concerns are not
separate. The service itself needs to know about the deployment environment, how to
check the status of the load balancer, and more. While this works, it doesn't make
for a very [Evolutionary Architecture](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/microservices-evolutionary-architecture).

## The Shawarma Solution

At CenterEdge, we've created our own, open source solution to this problem,
[Shawarma](https://github.com/CenterEdge/shawarma). Shawarma is specifically designed
for Kubernetes, and works via a modified version of the Colorful Service Approach.
It simplifies the design even further, and maintains separation of concerns by
keeping the application itself agnostic. It takes advatange of the Kubernetes API
and built-in support for watch commands to receive notifications about state changes
within the Kubernetes cluster.

In the Shawarma Approach, each service gets a single additional HTTP endpoint
which receives POST operations informing the service of its state, active or
inactive. It doesn't know anything at all about the deployment environment, it only knows
this single, basic data point.

The brains of the operation is a Shawarma sidecar deployed within the Kubernetes pod.
This sidecar container knows about Kubernetes and its Services and Endpoints, and monitors
Kubernetes to know if the application is active or inactive on the assigned
load balancer. When the status changes, it makes an HTTP POST calls to notify the main
service. The main service can then discontinue or restart any background processing, including
message bus processing.

## Shawarma Implementation

The Shawarma sidecar is implemented as a very lightweight Go application, available on
[Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/centeredge/repository/docker/centeredge/shawarma).
At this point it's in beta testing at CenterEdge, but the early signs are very
encouraging.

Additionally, we recognized very quickly that deployments needed to be kept as simple
as possible. The need to configure dozens of microservices with a sidecar container
was daunting. To that end, we've created a simple Kubernetes
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook). When the Shawarma Webhook is deployed,
a simple annotation on a Pod (or Deployment template) will automatically configure the sidecar.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: shawarma-example
    active: 'true'
  annotations:
    # The annotation value is name of the service for Shawarma to monitor
    shawarma.centeredge.io/service-name: shawarma-example
spec:
  # ...
```

A full example set [can be found here](https://github.com/CenterEdge/shawarma/tree/master/example/injected).

## Application State in ASP.NET Core

Since CenterEdge is a .NET shop, we've also implemented some supporting NuGet packages
to handle the application state.

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Shawarma.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shawarma.Abstractions/) | Basic abstractions and models |
| [Shawarma.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shawarma.AspNetCore/) | .NET Core middleware for receiving and handling application state |
| [Shawarma.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shawarma.AspNetCore.Hosting/) | The `IShawarmaService` system, an equivalent to [IHostedService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio) which starts and stops based on application state |

Using these SDK packages, adding slim, agnostic handling of Shawarma application state is easy.

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddMvc()
        .AddShawarmaHosting()
        // Add any IShawarmaService instances to be managed
        .AddShawarmaService<TestService>();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    // Add before MVC or other handlers
    app
        .UseShawarma()
        .UseMvc();
}
```

```cs
public class TestService : GenericShawarmaService
{
    public TestService(ILogger<TestService> logger)
        : base(logger)
    {
    }

    protected override Task StartInternalAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Start doing work here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    protected override Task StopInternalAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Stop doing work here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully, the Shawarma project will be helpful to other services deploying microservices
to Kubernetes. We're very open to feedback,
[issues may be filed at GitHub](https://github.com/CenterEdge/shawarma/issues). We'd also love some help from the community developing application state SDKs for other frameworks such as Java and Node.

It's also worth nothing that the Shawarma Approach is useful for more than just message
bus processing. Any kind of background work being handled outside of HTTP requests can
benefit, such as scheduled tasks or polling remote data sources.
