Frankly, it's always a pain to create ASP.NET machine keys for each of your web applications. I've written a little helper app that creates the <machineKey> section for your web.config file for you, with options for various encryption and validation algorithms.</p>

Special thanks go to Ben Strackany, who's article [ASP.NET: MachineKey Generator](http://archive.devwebpro.com/devwebpro-39-20061228ASPNETmachineKeyGenerator.html) I used as my starting point.
