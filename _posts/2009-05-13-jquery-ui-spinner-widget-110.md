I've uploaded a revised jQuery UI Spinner widget, version 1.10, based upon a lot of excellent feedback from the jQuery UI team. New features include mousewheel scrolling, decimal support, customizable prefixes/suffixes for currency/percents, improved input masking and maxlength handling, HTML5 markup support, lots of bug fixes, and more.

As it turns out, the jQuery UI team already had a spinner widget sitting in their files that hadn't been worked on in a while, so I'm working with Ca-Phun Ung to see if we can finish getting it up-to-date, polished, and with some of the new features from my widget incorporated into it. Stay tuned for more info.
