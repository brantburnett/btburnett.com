I've posted an update to the Partial Authentication System that fixes the following minor bugs:

- Fixed bug where PartialAuthentication properties weren't always initialized after application reload
- Fixed bug where invalid authentication tickets were raising exception instead of ignoring them

You can download the new source code and binaries here:

[Partial Authentication System 1.0.1.1 Source and Binary](/downloads/PartialAuthenticationSystem.1.0.1.1.zip)">
