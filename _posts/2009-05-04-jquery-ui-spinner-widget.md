In a project I was working on I was using jQuery UI and wanted to put a spinner on a numeric text box.  Then I discovered that jQuery UI, while an excellent UI library, doesn&#8217;t yet have a spinner widget.  So I decided to write one myself, and hope that one day it gets included in the core jQuery UI release.  Until then, please feel free to use the widget for yourselves, it&#8217;s a simple plugin for the jQuery UI core.
