<small>I&#8217;ve posted an improvement to the Partial Authentication System originally posted at <a href="http://blog.btburnett.com/2008/05/secure-persistent-aspnet-forms.html">Secure Persistent ASP.NET Forms Authentication</a>.</small>

<small>I discovered a problem in the automatic redirection of requests back to HTTP from HTTPS using the requiresSSL=&#8221;None&#8221; setting in the authorization section. Since most sites would set this to none for their root folder, this caused a problem with the links generated by ASP.NET and AJAX to WebResource.axd and ScriptResource.axd, which are logically (not physically) located in the root of the web application. If you have a secure page in another folder which requests these resources, they were being redirected back to an insecure connection, causing a potential security flaw and causing Firefox to display warnings about partial security.</small>

<small>This has been addressed by ignoring the requiresSSL=&#8221;None&#8221; setting for a request for any file with the &#8220;.axd&#8221; extension, effectively treating it as requiresSSL=&#8221;Optional&#8221; instead. Note that requiresSSL=&#8221;Required&#8221; is still enforced as normal for files with this extension.</small>

<small>I&#8217;ve posted new source and binaries for download.<br /> <span style="font-size:130%;"><br /> <strong>UPDATE: Please see updated version <a href="http://btburnett.com/2008/08/update-to-partial-authentication-system-2.html">here</a></strong><br /> </span></small>
