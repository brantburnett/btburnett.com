I've released a new open source tool that performs design-time compression of your CSS and Javascript files in Visual Studio projects.  This can be a big help, since it allows you to easily do it in your project rather than as part of your build/publish process.  And, since it leaves both the compressed and uncompressed versions in place, you can still use the uncompressed version for debugging.
