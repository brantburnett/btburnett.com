Ever since the advent of the .NET Framework, I've been a big fan. It's a quick and easy to use software development system, and it's great for most programming purposes.

However, I seem to be constantly coming up against development hurdles that leave me banging my head against the wall. When I try to find a solution to the problem by using my trusty Google search, I inevitably end up finding solutions to related problems, but never to the actual problem at hand. I've decided to dedicate this blog to those problems, and (sometimes second rate) solutions that I find for them.

Don't expect to see a whole lot of posts here, I'm not going to be posting the same how-tos that you find everywhere else on the net. Just expect to see some real world problems and the solutions that I've found for them as they come up. Hope that I can help someone out and save them from wasting all the time that I have.
